# CosmicPointSystem_Py
Use python estimate java system based on COSMIC-FFP
Also, we refer some object-oriented metrics, like CBO,ICP,CMIC.
This system contains two .py , cfp_analysis_SAVE.py and profiles.py.

profiles.py helps to catch all the componets that sequence diagram need, like class, method,return types, etc,and build a sequence diagram architecture.

The architecture shows the message in sequence diagram which seen as COSMIC function points.

cfp_analysis_SAVE.py use the architecture to count the maintenance project's function points and coupling metrics.

the function points and coupling metrics can help estimater estimate the maintenance project size.
